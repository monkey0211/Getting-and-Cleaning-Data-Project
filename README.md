## README


One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## Files

This repo file contains:

1) a tidy data set text file called "tidydata.txt" with the result of the analysis. 

2) a R script file "run_analysis.R" to perform the analysis.

3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data called "CodeBook.md".
